# CompanayE (SQL: Employee Tracker)



## PURPOSE

```bash
Running a business is a very complex task, and this comes with a constant demand in oversight on every aspect of life. This application makes this process of managing departments, staff, and their postions simple with a better process on organization.Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases (which is labeled as CMS <content management systems>). This application uses the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line.
